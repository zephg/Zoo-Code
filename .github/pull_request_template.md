### Pre-Submission Checklist

<!-- Go through this checklist before marking your PR as ready for review. -->

- [ ] **Issue Linked**: This PR is linked to an approved GitHub Issue (see "Related GitHub Issue" above).
- [ ] **Scope**: My changes are focused on the linked issue (one major feature/fix per PR).
- [ ] **Self-Review**: I have performed a thorough self-review of my code.
- [ ] **Testing**: New and/or updated tests have been added to cover my changes (if applicable).
- [ ] **Visual Snapshot** (UI changes only): If a user would notice this change at a glance (layout, theme tokens, brand elements, empty/error states), I've added or updated a `*.visual.tsx` snapshot in `webview-ui/`. See `webview-ui/AGENTS.md` → "When a UI change needs a snapshot".
- [ ] **Documentation Impact**: I have considered if my changes require documentation updates (see "Documentation Updates" section below).
- [ ] **Contribution Guidelines**: I have read and agree to the [Contributor Guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Visual Snapshots

<!--
For UI changes to static rendered state, the primary artifact is a committed
Playwright CT snapshot (`*.visual.tsx` in `webview-ui/`) — that baseline
becomes durable regression coverage for the surface. See
`webview-ui/AGENTS.md` for what deserves a snapshot.

Before/after screenshots pasted here are welcome as a review aid but are not a
substitute for the committed baseline. If a snapshot is possible, prefer the
snapshot.
-->

### Videos (interaction / animation only)

<!--
Snapshots cannot capture motion or multi-step flows. Attach a short screen
recording here when reviewers need to see:
  - A new interactive flow (dropdown, form, dialog progression)
  - Animation, transition, or timing behavior
  - A regression that only manifests during interaction

Videos are a review aid, not regression coverage. If the *result* of the
interaction has a distinct rendered state worth protecting, still commit a
`*.visual.tsx` snapshot of that end-state alongside the video.
-->

### Documentation Updates

<!--
Does this PR necessitate updates to user-facing documentation?
- [ ] No documentation updates are required.
- [ ] Yes, documentation updates are required. (Please describe what needs to be updated or link to a PR in the docs repository).
